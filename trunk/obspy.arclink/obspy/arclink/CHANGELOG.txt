dev:
 * requesting timespans (using 'starttime' and 'endtime' keywords) are
   deprecated in Client.getPAZ() and Client.getMetadata() - use 'time' instead
 * output format has changed for Client.getPAZ(..., time=dt)
 * 'getCoordinates' and 'getPAZ' keywords are deprecated in
   Client.getWaveform() - use 'metadata' instead
 * Client.getWaveform(..., metadata=True) will return both keywords as well as
   PAZ - inventory request is done only once per request -> huge performance
   improvement compared to previous implementation
 * traces requested via Client.getWaveform(..., metadata=True) covering
   multiple instrumentations will be splitted and the correct PAZ are appended
