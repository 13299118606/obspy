Overview
--------
NERIES web service client for ObsPy.

The obspy.neries package contains a client for the Seismic Data Portal
(http://www.seismicportal.eu) which was developed under the European
Commission-funded NERIES project. The Portal provides a single point of access
to diverse, distributed European earthquake data provided in a unique joint
initiative by observatories and research institutes in and around Europe.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see  Beyreuther et. al. 2010). The goal of the ObsPy
project is to facilitate rapid application development for seismology.
