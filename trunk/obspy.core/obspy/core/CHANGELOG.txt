dev:
 * stream.select works now case insensitive
 * support for initialization of UTCDateTime from numpy.string_ types
 * new dtype parameter on read method allows converting data into given dtype
 * implementation of __mul__ function for Trace and Stream objects
 * adding 'equal_scale' option to plot() method
 * new formatSeedLink method for UTCDateTime object
 * new split method for transforming streams containing masked arrays into
   contiguous traces
 * new resample method for Trace and Stream object
 * changed many setter/getter in UTCDateTime to private methods, e.g. _getDate 
 * added UTCDateTime.DEFAULT_PRECISION
 * import of an unsupported waveform will result into a TypeError [#338]
 * added compatibility methods for AttribDict and UTCDateTime
