dev:
 * Trace.__mod__ (splits Trace into Stream containing traces with num samples)
 * Trace.__div__ (splits Trace into Stream containing num traces)
 * new obspy.core.util.types.Enum class 
 * refactored obspy.core.util.ordereddict into obspy.core.util.types
 * refactored kilometer2degrees and locations2degrees from obspy.taup into
   obspy.core.util.geodetics
 * removing __hash__ fixture for Stream and Trace
 * new util.xmlwrapper module for uniform API for Python's default xml and lxml
 * plugin hooks in setup.py for QuakeML event files
 * stream.select works now case insensitive
 * support for initialization of UTCDateTime from numpy.string_ types
 * new dtype parameter on read method allows converting data into given dtype
 * implementation of __mul__ method for Trace and Stream objects
 * adding 'equal_scale' option to plot() method
 * new formatSeedLink method for UTCDateTime object
 * new split method for transforming streams containing masked arrays into
   contiguous traces
 * new resample method for Trace and Stream object
 * changed many setter/getter in UTCDateTime to private methods, e.g. _getDate 
 * added UTCDateTime.DEFAULT_PRECISION
 * import of an unsupported waveform will result into a TypeError [#338]
