Try and keep track of the methods I replace, in case they are called somewhere later.

in VelocityModel:

self.getBotDepth()	-->	self.botDepth		(and many others)

self.getVelocityLayer(i)	-->	self.layers[i]

layer (as arg to class)	-->	layers		(makes more sense, but careful)	

setTopSVelocity(bla)	-->	topSVelocity = bla	(oh Java why you so stupid)

getLayers(self)     -->     I think that just returned self.layers

endsWith() or startsW.. --> endswith() and startswith() (string methods)

in TauP_Create:
cf the special notes file.
Also removed get/setVelFileType, -ModelFilename, -Directory and DEBUG,
as these appear to be never called ever, anywhere, either.

in SlownessModel:
findDepth(int, double, double, bool)   -->   findDepth_from_depths
as the default is findDepth(int, int, int, bool)

toSlownessLayer(a_v_layer, ...) --> SlownessLayer.create_from_vlayer(a_v_layer, ...)
# the former returns: new SlownessLayer(vLayer, true, radiusOfEarth, isPWave)
# which is a different constructor (overloaded)!
