ObsPy Tutorial
==============

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single
feature. Instead, it introduces many of ObsPy's most noteworthy features, and
will give you a good idea of the libraryâ€™s flavor and style.

Basic Introduction
------------------

This section will introduce ObsPy's basic object types and how to use them.

Advanced Exercise
-----------------

In the advanced exercise we show how ObsPy can be used to develop an automated
processing workflow. We start out with very simple tasks and then automate the
routine step by step.
For all exercises solutions are provided.
