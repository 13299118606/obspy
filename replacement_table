Try and keep track of the methods I replace, in case they are called somewhere later.

in VelocityModel:

self.getBotDepth()	-->	self.botDepth		(and many others)

self.getVelocityLayer(i)	-->	self.layers[i]

layer (as arg to class)	-->	layers		(makes more sense, but careful)	

setTopSVelocity(bla)	-->	topSVelocity = bla	(oh Java why you so stupid)

getLayers(self)     -->     I think that just returned self.layers
