# How to contribute (wip)

This document aims to give an overview of how to contribute to ObsPy. It tries to answer commonly asked questions, and provide some insight into how the community process works in practice.

## Getting Started

 * Make sure you have a GitHub account
 * [Download](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and install git
 * Read the [git documentation](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics)
 

## Git workflow

We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

 1. Fork the repo.
 2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests.
 3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding  functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
 4. Make the test pass.
 5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
 6. Wait for our review. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
